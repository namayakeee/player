00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,177
In this lesson, we're going to
be talking about finance. And

2
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:10,009
one of the most important aspects
of finance is interest.

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,655
When I go to a bank or some
other lending institution

4
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,720
to borrow money, the bank is happy
to give me that money. But then I'm

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,480
going to be paying the bank for the
privilege of using their money. And that

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,440
amount of money that I pay the bank is
called interest. Likewise, if I put money

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,220
in a savings account or I purchase a
certificate of deposit, the bank just

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,800
doesn't put my money in a little box
and leave it there until later. They take

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,822
my money and lend it to someone
else. So they are using my money.

10
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:44,400
The bank has to pay me for the privilege
of using my money.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,700
Now what makes banks
profitable is the rate

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,330
that they charge people to use the bank's
money is higher than the rate that they

13
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,720
pay people like me to use my money. The
amount of interest that a person pays or
